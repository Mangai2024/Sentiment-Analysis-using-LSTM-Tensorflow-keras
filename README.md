📌 Project Overview

This project is a Sentiment Analysis Web App built using Hugging Face Transformers, TensorFlow. It takes user input (a text sentence) and predicts the sentiment as Positive, Negative, or Neutral with confidence scores.

🚀 Features

🔹 Real-time sentiment prediction

🔹 Pre-trained transformer model from Hugging Face

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 3.9+

Transformers (Hugging Face)

TensorFlow

In My project: ✅ Hugging Face = used for downloading + applying pre-trained NLP model for sentiment classification. ✅ TensorFlow = backend engine running the model.
